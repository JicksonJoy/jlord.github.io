At GitHub we think a lot about how people learn to use Git/GitHub and as a stil-new-ish person in web development I think a lot too about how I can share what I&#39;ve learned in a way that is meaningful to someone else starting out. I was excited about the challenge.</p>
<p>We called it Patchwork because each of us in open source contributes pieces to something bigger, quite literally and metaphorically we make quilts. Props to <a href="http://www.twitter.com/kelseyschimm">Kelsey</a> on this element.</p>

<em>@reporobot&#39;s quilt of patches</em></p>
<p>Fresh off the heels of NodeConf 2013 and the first <a href="http://www.nodeschool.io">nodeschool.io</a> workshops, I decided to make a Git based workshop and thus <a href="https://github.com/jlord/git-it">Git-it</a> was born. But I couldn&#39;t teach people how to use GitHub without someone to collaborate with—and I couldn&#39;t feasibly review and merge each and every pull request that came in—so <a href="https://github.com/reporobot">@reporobot</a> was born. As of writing he&#39;s helped <strong>1493</strong> people on Git-it!</p>
<p><img src="https://i.github-camo.com/5b47a379d1899b1e0004fd944eef30fe88e91dc4/687474703a2f2f636c2e6c792f696d6167652f3057304f33463338315132412f756e6e616d65642d312e6a7067" alt="patchworksf">
<em>photo by <a href="http://twitter.com/muanchoiu">@muanchoiu</a></em></p>
<p>So it was that a year ago we held the first Patchwork at GitHub&#39;s office in SF. It was nerve wracking for me (@reporobot was my first server!) but it went well, <em>whew</em>! We then had 14 more over the course of the 2014. GitHubbers hosted them where they were and we held Patchworks in London, Edinburgh, Nashville, Chicago, Columbus, Atlanta, New York City, Phoenix, Taipei, Tokyo and Boulder. Over <strong>700</strong> attendees!</p>
<p>We learned and iterated on the events. We used Git-it for some and then went web-based and command-line-free using the <a href="http://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world">Hello-World Guide</a>. Many props on content here to <a href="http://www.twitter.com/tenaciouscb">Chrissie</a> who works with more GitHub users than probably anyone.</p>
<p>We added talks. An introduction from a GitHubber on their first pull request and how they got involved with open source—dispel any ideas that developers were born developers. We all started somewhere. A closing talk from a local open source developer to introduce projects and real world open source practices.</p>
<p><img src="http://jlord.dev/git-it/assets/imgs/branches.png" alt="branch">
<em>Branching</em></p>
<p>I&#39;m really proud of Patchwork. It&#39;s a simple event for sharing skills and giving back. Locals volunteered their time to come out and mentor attendees, to sit down and talk about branching like someone once did with them, and I am ever so grateful to all of you! Equally thankful to all the GitHubbers who attended, hosted and helped pull these off.</p>
<p>Patchwork keep going 2015 and be even better with full time dedication, so keep an eye out! I&#39;ll step back and cheer it on and continue in my spare time to maintain Git-it and @reporobot. More on that soon!</p>

          <div class="post-header"><a href="simple-node-module.html"><h1>Node & npm Basics via a Simple Module</h1></a><ul><li>Jessica Lord</li> <li>2014-09-06</li> <li>Node.js, npm, Development</li></ul></div><div class="post-body"><p>The other day I wrote a simple Node module and thought it may be useful and digestible enough to look into and learn about some Node and npm Basics. If you have some questions about this module, you can <a href="http://www.github.com/jlord/cli-boilerplate/issues">open an issue</a> on the repo.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> <em>The module is <a href="https://github.com/jlord/cli-boilerplate">github.com/jlord/cli-boilerplate</a> and since this posting it&#39;s been updated (more features!) so I created a branch called</em> <code>tutorial</code> <em>on the repository, <a href="https://github.com/jlord/cli-boilerplate/tree/tutorial">here</a>, that matches the state of the project at the time of this writing to refer to as you read.</em></p>
<hr>
<p>Before anything, of course you&#39;ll need <a href="http://www.nodejs.org">Node.js</a> and npm (which comes with the Node install). Now, begin!</p>
<h2 id="start-with-a-problem">Start with a Problem</h2>
<p>When I start a new website I usually go and dig up some boilerplate HTML. I wanted to make &quot;dig up&quot; a little less work and since the boilerplate isn&#39;t but a couple dozen lines or so I thought it would be nice if I could just type a command and have it copied to my clipboard so that I could paste it into a new file. This is how <code>cli-boilerplate</code> was born.</p>
<p>In terminal there is already a command for sending text to the clipboard and with Node we can read contents of files and execute terminal commands. So, let&#39;s begin!</p>
<h2 id="initialize">Initialize</h2>
<p><a href="http://www.npmjs.org">npm</a> (nice people matter) is Node.js&#39;s package manager. It&#39;s what you use if you want publish your project so that others can easily use it. It&#39;s a registry of all the published modules and their versions. You can see the latest activity here <a href="https://www.npmjs.org">npmjs.org</a> (at time of writing, 93,291 packages!). You can write projects in Node and run it on your computer without npm, but if you intend to publish it as we do, you&#39;ll use npm.</p>
<h3 id="npm-init">npm init</h3>
<p>Create a new folder for your project to live in. Now in your terminal, navigate to that folder and run <code>npm init</code>. This kicks off a process that gets your <code>package.json</code> file started for you.</p>
<p><img src="http://f.cl.ly/items/170N1O2G1V0a263A2E37/Screen%20Shot%202014-09-07%20at%201.21.18%20PM.png" alt="npminit"></p>
<p>This file is like the title page, glossary, index and copyright page of a book rolled into one. You can get a sense of these files, and the JSON format, by checking out the <code>package.json</code> in existing projects (see <a href="https://github.com/maxogden/dat/blob/master/package.json">here</a>, <a href="https://github.com/mikeal/request/blob/master/package.json">here</a> and <a href="https://github.com/substack/node-optimist/blob/master/package.json">here</a>).</p>
<pre><code class="lang-bash"># make a new folder
$ mkdir cli-boilerplate
# go inside of folder
$ cd cli-boilerplate
# initialize!
$ npm init
</code></pre>
<p>You can fill out the information in terminal or hit enter and fill it out later in your text editor. When it&#39;s done you&#39;ll have a <code>package.json</code> file in your folder.</p>
<h4 id="beyond-the-basics">Beyond the basics</h4>
<p>Because I want to create a module that runs from the command line, I need to add a section in my <code>package.json</code> called <code>bin</code> which will allow me to define what file gets run when <em>x</em> word (command) is typed into terminal. I chose <code>boilme</code>. Haaa. I also added where the repository and issues are on GitHub as well as keywords for when people search npmjs.org.</p>
<pre><code class="lang-javascript">{

</code></pre>
<h2 id="create-the-boilerplate">Create the boilerplate</h2>
<p>We want to create the boilerplate HTML that we&#39;ll have copied to the clipboard for us when this module is used. This is easy as creating a new HTML file and filling it with the boilerplate:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-HTML">&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;
&lt;html lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;
  &lt;head&gt;
    &lt;meta charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;&gt;
    &lt;meta http-equiv=&quot;X-UA-Compatible&quot; content=&quot;IE=edge&quot;&gt;
    &lt;meta name=&quot;viewport&quot; content=&quot;width=device-width, initial-scale=1&quot;&gt;
    &lt;meta name=&quot;description&quot; content=&quot;&quot;&gt;
    &lt;meta name=&quot;author&quot; content=&quot;&quot;&gt;
    &lt;title&gt;Title&lt;/title&gt;
    &lt;link rel=&quot;icon&quot; type=&quot;image/png&quot; href=&quot;favicon.png&quot;&gt;
    &lt;link rel=&quot;stylesheet&quot; href=&quot;assets/style.css&quot;&gt;
  &lt;/head&gt;
  &lt;body&gt;
  &lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
</code></pre>
<h2 id="write-the-code">Write the code</h2>
<p>Now we&#39;ll create the actual code in a file named <code>index.js</code>, which is a common name for your main file. Below is the full code, it&#39;s pretty short! A lot of node modules are simple and do just one thing, like this one. We&#39;ll go through each part.</p>
<pre><code class="lang-javascript">#!/usr/bin/env node

var fs   = require(&#39;fs&#39;)
var path = require(&#39;path&#39;)
var exec = require(&#39;child_process&#39;).exec

fs.readFile(path.join(__dirname, &#39;boilerplate.html&#39;), function read(err, data) {
  if (err) return console.log(err)
  var command = &quot;echo &#39;&quot; + data.toString() + &quot;&#39; | pbcopy&quot;
  exec(command, function clipboarded(err, stdout, stdrr) {
    if (err) return console.log(err)
    console.log(&quot;Copied!&quot;)
  })
})
</code></pre>
<h3 id="the-environment">The Environment</h3>
<p>At the very top we use <code>#!/usr/bin/env node</code>. Remember in <code>package.json</code> we set &quot;./index.js&quot; as the file we wanted to run after someone types <code>boilme</code>? Using this line at the top of <code>index.js</code> tells the computer when it starts to read it that it should execute — <code>#!/</code> (shebang) — the code below it and do so using Node.</p>
<h3 id="require-other-modules">Require other modules</h3>
<p>Node.js comes with a <a href="http://nodejs.org/api/">core set of modules</a> that help you do lots of things. If there is something that is outside of the scope of core, that&#39;s when you&#39;ll use npm to find something created by someone else.</p>
<p>This project, being simple, just uses core modules. In this section we are requiring the core modules we want and giving them a name:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-javascript">var fs   = require(&#39;fs&#39;)
var path = require(&#39;path&#39;)
var exec = require(&#39;child_process&#39;).exec
</code></pre>
<p>When you require a module, all of the functions inside of it become accessible to you in your code through the name you set for it. For instance, I can use the things that come with <code>fs</code> when I use the variable <code>fs</code> in my script.</p>
<p><strong>fs</strong> is a module for the file system, letting us read or write files (and more!) on a computer</p>
<p><strong>path</strong> is a utility for working with file paths (locations)</p>
<p><strong>child_process</strong> allows us to run another process, outside of the one we&#39;re already in. Using the <code>exec</code> part of it allows us to specifically run a shell (command line) process</p>
<h3 id="action-">Action!</h3>
<p>Next we&#39;ll actually use this modules to:</p>
<ol>
<li>Read the contents of the boilerplate HTML file.</li>
<li>Create a <em>string</em> of the command we&#39;d type in terminal if we were manually giving it text to send to the clipboard.</li>
<li>Use <code>exec</code> to create a shell process and give it our command to run.</li>
</ol>
<p>Let&#39;s break it down some more. Here is all the code:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-javascript">fs.readFile(path.join(__dirname, &#39;boilerplate.html&#39;), function read(err, data) {
  if (err) return console.log(err)
  var command = &quot;echo &#39;&quot; + data.toString() + &quot;&#39; | pbcopy&quot;
  exec(command, function clipboarded(err, stdout, stdrr) {
    if (err) return console.log(err)
    console.log(&quot;Copied!&quot;)
  })
})
</code></pre>
<h4 id="read-file">Read file</h4>
<p>We use <code>fs</code> to read the file, it wants to know where the file is and what to do after it has read it, the callback. The callback is a function that is run after the main task (reading the file contents) has completed. It will automatically get passed in first an error, if there was one, and the the contents of the file, but buffered, which means numbers (we&#39;ll change that later). Here&#39;s what the basic format looks like: <code>fs.readFile(&#39;filelocation&#39;, callback)</code>.</p>
<p>The <code>boilerplate.html</code> will be located wherever this module exists on the users computer, so we&#39;ll use <code>__dirname</code> to get the location of the module on the computer and <code>path.join</code> to add <code>boilerplate.html</code> to that. That gives us the full address of the file on the computer.</p>
<p>Then we pass in our callback, a function we create called &#39;read&#39; because it&#39;s going to get run when the file has finished being read. Next is a common pattern in Node -- we check to see if there were any errors reading the file. If there were, we want give up because there&#39;s no use doing the rest of the work. So if there is an error, we return, but we print with <code>console.log()</code>out what the error was.</p>
<p>But, if there were no errors, we&#39;ll move right along!</p>
<h4 id="run-copy-command">Run copy command</h4>
<p>We create a string to contain what the full command would be in terminal if we were doing this manually. In Mac terminals you can type <code>echo &quot;Hello World!&quot;</code> and it will print out the string you gave it. You can feed that text directly into another function using a &quot;pipe&quot; which is this &quot;|&quot; character. We want to feed it into the copy command which is <code>pbcopy</code> on Macs. So typing <code>echo &quot;Hello World!&quot; | pbcopy</code> will put &quot;Hello World&quot; in our clipboard and and the next time we paste, we&#39;ll get &quot;Hello World&quot;.</p>
<p>Since <code>fs.readFile</code> returns a buffer of numbers, we&#39;ll use the JavaScript method <code>.toString()</code> to turn it into the letters and spaces we recognize.</p>
<p>Using <code>exec</code> we spawn a new independent shell process to which we can give our shell command. It also takes in a callback, a function for what to do after it&#39;s run that command. We want it to quit and print the error if there was an error, but if there was no error, print &quot;Copied!&quot;.</p>

<p>Now that the file is done, we can test it by running it on our computer. If we&#39;re in the <code>cli-clipboard</code> directory we can type <code>npm link</code> so that npm will use this version we&#39;ve made as the global module.</p>
<pre><code class="lang-bash">$ cd cli-clipboard
$ npm link
# it will print text about the linkage
$ boilme
# it should work!
</code></pre>
<p>Next publish what you&#39;ve done to your npm account (if you don&#39;t have one, <a href="https://www.npmjs.org/signup">set one up</a>):</p>
<pre><code class="lang-bash">$ npm publish
</code></pre>

<p>That&#39;s the whole thing! We have a <code>package.json</code> so that we can register our module with npm and others can use it, we have our <code>boilerplate.html</code> file with our dream boilerplate, and we have the itty bitty <code>index.js</code> script to make what we want to happen, happen.</p>
<p>This post is way longer than I thought it would be. I tried to save space and didn&#39;t mention it, but you should also being using Git when you&#39;re building something and checking-in often to save your work and push it to GitHub.</p>
<h3 id="other-files">Other files</h3>
<p>The project also has a <code>README.md</code> and <code>LICENSE.md</code> file. They&#39;re not required to make a module, but they&#39;re really important files to have in a project. The former tells people how to use your project and the later shows the license the project is under. Some places can&#39;t use un-licensed projects, so it&#39;s important to add one!</p>

That&#39;s 365 days of learning, laughing and working on something I care about. That&#39;s lucky!</p>
<p>A little over two years ago I was an urban designer for a lovely city on the east coast. Then I spent 2012 as a Code for America <a href="http://www.codeforamerica.org">fellow</a> and fell hard for open source and GitHub. </p>
<p>Open source and GitHub were the community and mindset missing from my way of working before, only I didn&#39;t know it then. I did know, however, that I wanted to build more and ship more (only I didn&#39;t know it was called &#39;ship&#39; then). Hello, GitHub!</p>
<p>Now not only do I get to use GitHub everyday but I get to be a part of making GitHub as great as it can be — the tool, the company, the community. And I get to do this with an amazing group of people that are talented, passionate and hilarious. They inspire me with code and wit every day.</p>
<p>I work in particular on making GitHub.com better for new users and that gets me pretty jazzed. I remember quite well what it is like to be a new user and new to open source. I remember searching (and still do — because, never stop learning) for resources online to learn new things. I want to help others improve the way they work with GitHub, I want others to come to GitHub and start contributing to open source. I love working on the tools to help people do that.</p>
<p>The more people out there building things and working together, the better.</p>
<p>But the big, big thing for me working at GitHub has been that, more than I realized could be possible at the place you work, I know my coworkers want to see me happy and succeeding. I am myself everyday. I truly feel appreciated and that I have impact and potential. I try not to take these things for granted.</p>
<p>I thought I&#39;d return to urban design after CfA but when I decided to work at GitHub I was also deciding to keep doing this software development thing. It&#39;s crazy to think about what I know now compared to what I knew a year ago. I&#39;ve learned so much. I wouldn&#39;t have been able to do so if it  weren&#39;t for a company that shares my goals, champions people and gives me the freedom to shape my experience. I want to keep learning (more Node and even some Rails), keep spreading the knowledge (<a href="https://github.com/blog/1805-patchwork-night">Patchwork</a> nights! <a href="http://guides.github.com">Guides</a>!) and I&#39;m proud to do it as a <a href="https://github.com/blog/1504-jessica-lord-is-a-githubber">GitHubber</a>.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve just updated <a href="http://www.github.com/jlord/sheetsee.js">Sheetsee.js</a> with new features and all new docs. I&#39;ve been waiting to ship this, it feels like, for far too long. I&#8217;m hoping now Sheetsee is at a solid enough place that I can focus spare time on making more <a href="http://www.jlord.dev/fork-n-go">fork-n-go</a> examples.</p>
<p>I&#39;ll get straight to the most exciting point: the new <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0Ao5u1U6KYND7dGN5QngweVJUWE16bTRob0d2a3dCbnc&amp;usp=drive_web&amp;pli=1#gid=0">sample data</a> for the demos is of my <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/jessllord/sets/72157640471928365/">flattened penny collection</a>. Below are the other things.</p>
<h3 id="new-features">New Features</h3>
<p>Yay!</p>
<h4 id="tables-pagination-multi-table-sorting-and-filtering">Tables: Pagination, Multi Table Sorting and Filtering</h4>
<p>Tables can now be paginated so that you don&#8217;t have to display your entire spreadsheet of data in one go. Unless you want to.</p>
<p>Tables now supports having multiple tables with sorting and filtering. So long as you keep your table IDs straight, you&#8217;re golden.</p>
See: <a href="http://jlord.github.io/sheetsee.js/demos/demo-table.html">table demo</a>
<h4 id="maps-polygons-and-lines">Maps: Polygons and Lines</h4>
<p>Maps now support polygons and lines. So long as you have the correct coordinate structure in your cells, Sheetsee will add them to the geoJSON it creates for your maps. More details for coordinates of lines and polygons in geoJSON are <a href="http://leafletjs.com/examples/geojson.html">here</a>, but briefly:</p>
<p>A linestring:</p>
<pre><code>[-122.41722106933594, 37.7663045891584], [-122.40477561950684, 37.77695634643178]
</code></pre><p>A polygon:</p>
<pre><code>[-122.41790771484375, 37.740381166384914], [-122.41790771484375, 37.74520008134973], [-122.40966796874999, 37.74520008134973],[-122.40966796874999, 37.740381166384914], [-122.41790771484375, 37.740381166384914]

</code></pre><p>See: <a href="http://jlord.github.io/sheetsee.js/demos/demo-map.html">map demo</a>.</p>
<h3 id="documentation">Documentation</h3>
<p>I redid the documentation and website for Sheetsee. Instead of one <em>gigantic</em> readme file/website, all of the different elements are given their own file/page. Now you can find docs, demos, tips and such all filed away nicely here in the <a href="http://www.github.com/jlord/sheetsee.js">repository</a> and on the <a href="http://jlord.github.io/sheetsee.js">website</a>.</p>
<h3 id="modules">Modules</h3>
<p>The other big thing that has happened to Sheetsee is that I&#39;ve taken each component (core, maps, tables and charts) and made them into their own Node.js module. This makes for smaller, more manageable code files and it makes it so that users can build their own version of Sheetsee with just the elements they want to use. For instance, if you&#39;re only making maps, just build a Sheetsee with the map component.</p>
<p>All builds come with the <code>sheetsee-core</code> module which contains all of the data organizing functions.</p>
<p>The module <code>sheetsee</code> is a command line module that builds your custom sheetsee for you.</p>
<p>If you&#39;re not interested in Node modules or building anything, that&#39;s ok, too. I&#39;ll always keep a full build (with all the components) here in <a href="https://github.com/jlord/sheetsee.js/tree/master/js">the sheetsee.js repository</a> (which from here on out exists to be the consolidated documentation and source of a full build).</p>
<p>If you need to file an issue for a bug or feature, try and file it on the repository with the component it relates to (they each have their own repository now):</p>

<p>There are lots of ways you can take data from you Google Spreadsheet and use it in a website in cool ways. I&#8217;m going to do a few posts on such things. Neat!</p>
<p>If your spreadsheet contains address information, using templates (<a href="http://jlord.github.io/sheetsee.js">Sheetsee.js</a> uses a form of <a href="https://github.com/janl/mustache.js">Mustache</a>), you can embed those elements into a Google Maps URL query string (this is the same URL that is generated when you type in an address into the search bar yourself) and create links/buttons that will open locations up directly in Google Maps on desktops and phones. Similarly you can put them in Yelp queries, too.</p>
<p>The basic elements are: <em>a spreadsheet with address info + HTML template to create the query string</em>.</p>
<h3 id="par-exemple">Par Exemple</h3>
<p>The Sheetsee <a href="http://jlord.github.io/hack-spots/">Hack-Spots</a> is an does such a thing. Here is the <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0Ao5u1U6KYND7dFVkcnJRNUtHWUNKamxoRGg4ZzNiT3c#gid=0">spreadsheet</a>, with address information:</p>
<p><img src="http://jlord.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/Screen-Shot-2013-09-15-at-6.49.19-PM.png" alt="spreadsheet"></p>
<p>In the HTML template for the table on the <a href="http://jlord.github.io/hack-spots/">Hack-Spots page</a>, the button&#39;s links look like this:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-HTML">&lt;a class=&quot;button&quot; href=&quot;https://maps.google.com/maps?q={{address}},{{city}},{{state}}&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;View in Google Maps&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;a class=&quot;button&quot; href=&quot;http://www.yelp.com/search?find_desc={{name}}&amp;find_loc={{city}},{{state}}&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Find on Yelp&lt;/a&gt;
</code></pre>
<p><a href="https://github.com/jlord/hack-spots/blob/gh-pages/index.html#L62">Here</a> is the exact line of code on GitHub.</p>
<p>We&#39;re inserting the <strong>address</strong>, <strong>city</strong>, and <strong>state</strong> details from the spreadsheet into the structure of a query string for Google maps and Yelp. You can figure out the query string of a service by just using it (type in an address in Google Maps) and looking at the resulting URL.</p>
<p>With a some CSS and such, the resulting website has a table with the hack spots and a button for viewing in Google Maps or Yelp:</p>
<p><img src="http://jlord.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/Screen-Shot-2013-09-15-at-6.43.54-PM.png" alt="table"></p>
<p>When the page builds, it creates the correct link for each row. When someone clicks on the buttons it takes them directly to the Google Map search result for that address. BAM!</p>
